You might remember learning about the myth of how the ancient city of Athens received its name. On top of the city’s acropolis, a legendary competition took place: Poseidon struck the ground to produce a spring of sea water while Athena gifted the people an olive tree. Although one was a grand display of power, the other’s strength lay in its enduring utility. The competition resulted in a clear victor, crowning Athena as the patron goddess of the city. Her gift of the tree would go on to be a living testament of her wisdom and insight as seen in not only its continuing presence in the city’s landscape, but also in the ubiquity of olives and olive oil globally to this day.

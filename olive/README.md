### Introduction
<i>Olea europaea</i>, better known as the olive tree, has long shaped and been shaped by the built and cultivated landscapes of the Eastern Mediterranean. Though many may first associate the olive with the "Mediterranean diet," its significance goes beyond just cuisine. Between tree, fruit, and oil, the olive traverses sacred foundations, ancestral practices, and contemporary reinventions. What might this one plant reveal about how people in the Eastern Mediterranean have defined their identities, histories, and landscapes across time? More specifically, how has the olive become a marker of community and a means of place-making?

### Sacred Landscapes
You might recall learning about the myth of how the ancient city of Athens received its name. On top of the city’s acropolis, a legendary competition unfolded: Poseidon struck the ground to summon a spring of seawater, while Athena gifted the people an olive tree. Although one was a grand display of power, the other’s strength lay in its enduring utility. The competition resulted in a clear victor, crowning Athena as the patron goddess of the city. Her gift of the olive became a living testament to her wisdom, seen today in the continued presence of olives in Athens’ landscape and their ubiquity worldwide.

While this mythic contest may be the most celebrated story of the olive tree in antiquity, the olive makes an often forgotten, yet no less significant, appearance in Homer’s Odyssey--an appearance that reveals the overlooked and deeply ideological symbol of the olive. After many trials and a long journey, Odysseus finally returns to his home Ithaca in Book 13. Homer describes the initial view of the island:
>At the harbor’s head a branching olive stands
>
>with a welcome cave nearby it, dank with sea-mist,
>
>sacred to nymphs of the springs we call the Naiads.

Caves have fascinated philosophers and readers for centuries due to their mysterious and allegorical nature of human epistemology and cosmology. However, very few dwell on this section of Homer's story of his cave of nymphs. Yet, this seemingly minor detail in the grand scheme of Odysseus' heroic travels caught the attention of the Neoplatonist philosopher Porphyry. Porphyry writes:
>The olive, a symbol of god’s thoughtfulness, grows next to the image of the world, which is the cave. The olive tree belongs to Athena and Athena is thoughtfulness…at the same time, the tree is something separate from the cave (as divine wisdom is something separate from the world), but set nearby at the head of the entire harbor. 

For Porphyry, in his exegesis, the olive tree represents "thoughtfulness" through its intimate link to Athena, but it is also important to note that the tree functions as a boundary marker: it stands outside at the threshold of the cave, not within, mediating between the realm of the gods and the world of men, the human soul and the cosmos. Whether or not we follow Porphyry’s metaphysical readings, interpretations such as his and the creation myth of Athena’s gift reveal an undeniable influence and connection between the natural world and humanity. Specifically, we glimpse the olive’s deeper role as a mediator and marker–a living network that binds the sacred to the everyday, land to person, and past to present across the landscapes of the Eastern Mediterranean into the world.

### Cultivating Fruit and Faith
Yet, the olive’s symbolic and spiritual weight did not diminish with the shift to monotheistic religions Especially in Christian doctrine, the olive tree becomes a powerful metaphor and imagery for divine covenants and the rapidly evolving religious communities. Take, for instance, the story of Noah and the flood from the Old Testament: after a year on the ark, Noah sends out a dove which returns with an olive branch, marking the end of the flood and a new beginning for humanity. Furthermore, kings were anointed with olive oil since the Old Testament, namely King David, as a way of demonstrating their divine authority to rule. Centuries later in the New Testament, we see the olive being used in a slightly different manner. The Apostle Paul writes in Romans 11:24: 
>For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree.

To understand Paul’s metaphor, we must first grasp the agricultural context. Terms such as 
"grafting" or "wild" and "cultivated" olives would have been general knowledge to the Romans–a testament to the omnipresence of olives in the region. 

Grafting was a popular technique for tree propagation in ancient agriculture, and it is still commonly used today. While there are multiple types of grafting, the general process of crown grafting involves inserting the branch or cutting of one plant directly into the stock of another, which is then bound and sealed tightly. Eventually, the introduced cutting will join and grow with the original plant, producing a desired result such as fruits. Theophrastos, an ancient Greek philosopher and one of the first botanists, wrote extensively about grafting cultivated olives into wild olive stocks (Olea oleaster), which would then produce the olives suitable for making oil and eating. Cultivated olive trees, due to this process of domestication, bear the larger fruits that we today are familiar with, while wild trees produce many small ones. If an old branch ceased to bear fruit, it could be cut off and a new young olive branch would be grafted in. Thus, olive trees were rarely ever cultivated starting from just the seed.

Returning to the Apostle Paul, with this technical process in mind, Paul’s message to the Romans becomes even more compelling. In his metaphor, the cultivated olive tree represents God’s divine covenant (salvation) with the Jewish people, while the branches cut from the wild tree symbolize the Gentiles. The Gentiles are all non-Jewish people who were outside the original covenant. Grafting, then, becomes more than just a cultivation technique: it serves as an imagery of identity, inclusion, and unity within the dichotomy of cultivated and wild. Paul’s message extends the promise of belonging and spiritual kinship to those who were once outsiders. In a sense, grafting is like adoption.

Furthermore, it is also important to consider the words "contrary to nature" when Paul describes the process of grafting. Roman authors such as Virgil, Ovid, Columella, Palladius, and others heavily discuss this topic as well as grafting’s anthropomorphic undertones. Though some discourse considers grafting as unnatural or even as a violent human intervention, many of these historical authors saw grafting ultimately as a positive and beautiful act of cultivation. Ovid writes:
>While the new branch is growing into the green bark,
>
>If any breeze shakes the delicate thing, it will fall out.
>
>Soon, when it is hardened by time, the same branch will resist the winds,
>
>And the sturdy tree will keep its adopted bounty.

Here, the process of grafting reflects not only a plant’s resilience but also its ability to accommodate and accept, explicitly emphasizing the metaphor of adoption. Ovid also highlights the element of temporality such that this is a process that takes time for the two parts to grow together. Therefore, thinking back to Athena's gift of the olive tree to the Athenians, we see the olive tree as a sacred gift once again: this time, one that stands for the creation of a living network of acceptance and faith.

### Lighting the Sacred
Furthermore, olives serve not only as religious symbols and metaphors, but also as functional elements in ritual practice through one of its most critical aspects: the oil. Beyond just daily consumption or culinary use, olive oil has long played a versatile role in the Mediterranean including for lighting, aromatics, and medicine. Perfumed oils, often associated with Christian relics but tracing back to even the Minoans of the Bronze Age (from written accounts of Linear B tablets), could be used for anointing, healing, and veneration. In fact, later in the Middle Ages, holy olive oil was believed to cure demonic possessions and was credited with miraculous healing capabilities. Yet, perhaps one of the most intriguing is the use of oil for light, illuminating both ritual spaces and daily life since antiquity till today.

Within the domestic sphere, the ability to illuminate large spaces was a visible sign of wealth in the ancient world, as it required sustaining and consuming significant quantities of olive oil–an extremely expensive task. However, in religious contexts, light is almost always associated with divine presence among humans. In churches, temples, and other religious sanctuaries, lamps could be the sole illuminator of a space or even the object of veneration. The steady burn as well as its low smoke made olive oil the preferable choice to other fats, though continual flow is necessary to sustain the light for extended periods of time. Many sanctuaries are still brightened by olive oil lamps to this day.

It is also important to consider the shared experience and phenomenology of light as something that occupies lived-in or communal spaces. The soft glow of the oil lamp defines the interior and ultimately the movement within a space, bringing lightness to the dark and filling the interior.  It would not have been used like a torch on the exterior. Therefore, olive oil once again becomes a medium that allows for this sacred connection between not only humans and the divine, but now also between fellow humans and the built environment. But perhaps, nothing expresses these shared human connections the same way as an energetic sports game like the Panathenaic Games.

The Panathenaic Games, held in Athens since 566 BC, were athletic and cultural competitions in honor of the patron goddess Athena. Crowds anticipated the major celebrations every four years, and these games remained a core part of public life until the 4th century AD. The procession of the festival which ended at the Acropolis transformed the entire landscape of the city and its people into a sacred landscape as seen in the depictions on the Parthenon frieze. It involved every person in the city regardless of status or citizenship, therefore demonstrating the festivities’ capabilities of uniting people and landscape.

Victors of the games were crowned with olive wreaths and awarded a prized amphora containing oil made from sacred olive trees–a victory demonstrating the pinnacle of achievement and a tribute to the founding myth of the city. In fact, oil made from these sacred groves had strict laws to protect them from getting cut or damaged, ensuring only specific individuals were allowed to handle these trees. Thus, these games weren’t merely just popular festivities, but rather a major religious event involving civic engagement on the foundations of Athens’ heritage and identity.

However, we must consider the true depth of the meaning of this gift of olive oil as more than just an athletic reward. To receive this oil was to receive not just personal glory but an emblem of civic pride, reinforcing the winners’ and the city’s shared identity with the goddess Athena and the olive at its core. In distributing the oil as a prize, the city also enacted a subtle form of political power: spreading the influence and reputation of Athens through a gift that was both religious and economic, or perhaps something of "Athenian" heritage. The olive oil thus became a vessel for the ideals of glory, honor, and community.

Similar to the religious use of oil, olive oil in the games had both a sacred or intangible component and a functional use. Many athletes would anoint their bodies with olive oil before competing and later use a strigil to scrape it off. Even today, in parts of northern Greece, Turkey, and Bulgaria (modern day Thrace), oil wrestling remains a popular competitive sport and tourist attraction. For the ancient Greeks, understanding the human body was significantly more than just a physical state: being healthy was also a matter of moral urgency. They understood that the discipline required of athletes signified immense self-control. The "athlete’s ‘greatest contest’ is for the integrity of the soul, and he or she must be always in training, akêsis, for the fight against the onslaughts of desire. This training is both for soul and for body." Therefore, health didn’t just emphasize the physical toil in gymnasiums, but rather should be reflected in all other parts of daily life including what was consumed for nourishment.

### Behind Eastern Mediterranean Dining
Wine, olive oil, and grain, long considered the triad of the Eastern Mediterranean, find their way into almost every meal. As seen in Hippocratic texts, proper eating became a daily practice of harmony: one selected foods not just for taste, but for their ability to restore balance and promote both physical and spiritual well-being. As previously mentioned, olive oil was especially prized for its medicinal properties, religious use, and versatility. But what about the act of eating itself?

In ancient Greek society, the table was a place where the boundaries between the individual and the community, the private and the public sphere were continually shaped and reinforced. Dining, however, was never an isolated, private affair. "Yet it is not possible to discover a way for the body to attain a pleasure more justifiable than that which comes from eating and drinking…and [sharing] together banquets and tables," wrote Plutarch in his Moralia, capturing the mentality that to share food was to share identity. Banqueting and ritual feasting, whether at a symposium, a religious festival, or a civic gathering, were central moments of public life and a stage for social exchange. Scholars claim that to be invited to the table was to be included, to belong. Exclusion from communal eating meant a form of social isolation. Dining and matters of cuisine go even as far to label what was considered "civilized."

Thinking back to the dichotomy of the wild versus cultivated olive tree, we see another division appear: the civilized and the supposed uncivilized. This separation was furthered by the distinct use of certain culinary ingredients between the north and south of the western world. Viticulture and olive growing were suited for the warmer climate and elevation of the Mediterranean, setting the region apart from the neighbors of the north who depended on butter. The civilizations of the Mediterranean believed that "wine and oil were also a mark of a civilized society, which were able to create its own plants and animals by farming the land and raising livestock." Therefore, the power of cultivation, to be able to shape land and even culture, was a highly valued form of knowledge.

### Harvesting Techniques
Even before reaching the dining table, the communal nature of the olive is clearly seen within the act of cultivation. We’ve briefly discussed the process of grafting, but not surprisingly, immense labor is required for the picking and processing of olives. Though slave labor was commonly used in large scale plantations of antiquity, for many villages, the olive harvest was–and still is–a communal event, drawing together neighbors, kin, and entire communities. No individual could possibly maintain an entire grove, harvest the fruits, crush the olives, and later press them into oil alone. 

Instead, groups of people gather around a single tree, some climbing high into branches, and others from the ground wielding long sticks or rake-like tools to gently remove the olives from the tree. The fruits all fall onto large pieces of cloth lying around the base of the tree or kept in personal baskets. Groups move from tree to tree together, gathering the olives that collected on the cloth after finishing the whole tree. Therefore, olives are a shared experience. It depends on collective effort and the transmission of specific skills and knowledge across generations and traditions within sedentary communities. Given how long olive trees take to mature, those who plant them do so knowing the full benefit belongs to later generations.

This notion is mirrored in the tree itself. The olive tree’s extraordinary longevity allows it to serve as a living history, bearing witness to the lives and labors of countless generations. As the Roman agronomist Columella observed,
>If it is neglected for many years, it does not deteriorate like the vine, but even during this period it nevertheless offers something to the head of the household and, when it is cultivated again, it recovers in a single year.

Even the core structure of harvesting and making olive oil has changed very little from antiquity. For example, ancient tools like the rotary crusher or trapetum, used to crush the olives and operated by animals, closely resemble today’s mechanized olive crushers. While many societies have risen and fallen over the centuries, the olive has remained a living witness and a critical component of Eastern Mediterranean civilizations. Yet this history of olives is not only preserved in traditions or tools, it is also inscribed in the land of the Eastern Mediterranean itself.

### Contemporary Landscapes
Across the hills and slopes of the Mediterranean, the landscape bears an imprint of ecological domestication. The rows of terraces and ditches, cultivation strategies developed for plants like the olive to manage rocky terrain and limited rainfall, are still visible and utilized across entire regions and sometimes entire islands (though their use in antique practice is not confirmed). Beyond the functional aspect for propagation purposes, these methods also demonstrate a spatial language of power and control. Groves planted in deliberate geometric arrangements reflect agricultural rationality, but they also express a cultural logic where land was meant to be ordered, bounded, and fruitful.

An archaeologist and professor of Ancient Greek history Lin Foxhall writes:
>Order and symmetry were integral to the representation of the triumph of human control over the landscape, so perhaps it is not surprising that they become essential elements of the principles of beauty in general and decorative planting in particular. Regular patterns and lines, composed of well-shaped and blanched forms of individual plants, constituted the most pleasing kind of planting.

Therefore, we see that there is a desire for "pleasure" as well when it comes to cultivation, not just utility. Landscapes become a visual testament to humanity’s assumed dominion over the natural world.

Yet, the supposed permanence suggested by these landscape forms conceals a growing threat. Even back in the Roman period, 
>There was an ecological price to pay for the economic expansion achieved in some areas of the Roman world. Research is needed to assess the potential environmental debit of intensive olive farming, but it is self-evident that the more marginal soils on to which the olive spread in this period were precisely those most likely to suffer long-term depletion.

Measures like the *annona militaris*, a military tax of goods such as oil, wheat, and wine imposed by the Roman Emperor Septimius Severus (ruled 193-211 AD) contributed to this rapid expansion of production during the Roman empire. Entire cities would focus solely on cultivating, producing, and most importantly trading oil as seen in cities like Elaiussa Sebaste (which means "olive grove of Augustus"). The demand and consumption of oil has only increased since. In today’s groves, irrigation, industrial monoculture, and high-density intensive practices have placed a strain on both ecosystems and communities. Although the core process has changed little since antiquity, the recent shift towards mechanized methods of harvesting to maximize output are slowly causing the ancestral techniques of the past to lose their place in the modern world of olives.

This development overtime has resulted in "simplified landscapes with olive groves with low-nature-value, driving greater negative environmental impacts (EIs), particularly in the form of soil erosion, run-offs to water bodies, increased rates of soil fertility loss, degradation of habitats and landscapes, and over-exploitation of scarce and vulnerable water resources." According to the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of high-density olive groves in Andalusia, virgin olive oil production emits about 1.59 to 3.26 kg of CO2 eq. per kg. This emits about the same kg of CO2 as burning 1 liter of gasoline (approximately 8 miles of driving).

One of the most visible ecological crises that has devastated not just the Mediterranean but also California is *Xylella fastidiosa*: a bacterial pathogen that blocks the movement of water through a tree. Spread by xylem-feeding insects, *Xylella* has wreaked havoc across southern Europe, with its most catastrophic outbreak beginning in 2013 in the region of Apulia in Italy, a historic center of olive oil production.

Within years, entire groves of centuries-old trees withered and died. In an effort to contain the outbreak, the European Union mandated the chopping and removal of infected trees as well as the surrounding trees. This move was met with widespread protests by local communities who saw these trees as more than just agricultural assets. To these communities, the forced uprooting felt like an erasure of identity, a severing of the deeply rooted relationship between land, cultural memory, and livelihood. The impact of Xylella thus extends beyond biology: it exhibits the very notion of a landscape as a manifestation of cultural continuity.

Groves may still appear orderly from afar, but many are abandoned, neglected, or managed under unsustainable conditions. Ironically, the very aesthetics that once proclaimed mastery over nature now risks potential ecological crisis. However, there have been innovative efforts to revive olive groves such as the regenerative farming technique of animal-plant husbandry as seen in the video. Many do not realize the value of groves as carbon sinks and the potential opportunities for sustainable agricultural practices. Perhaps a deeper understanding of the ancestral techniques could identify an area of opportunity or at the very least highlight the dangers of current methods.

### Extra Virgin
As *Xylella* reshapes physical landscapes, a parallel phenomenon unfolds in the realm of ecotourism and branding, where the image of the grove as "ancient" and "Mediterranean" is being repackaged for global consumption. You are likely familiar with "extra virgin" olive oil from the grocery store, but what does this phrase actually mean? Fortunately, it is not just a marketing tactic. It does indeed reflect the grade of the olive oil such that "extra virgin" olive oil is made from unripe (green) olives. This yields better tasting and higher quality olive oil after undergoing meticulous taste testing–a method that has been used to determine the quality since ancient times.

However, in the growing market for ecotourism and agro-experiences, the olive tree has been marketed as a symbol of "authentic" Mediterranean life. Travelers seek out oil tastings, harvest festivals, olive aesthetic merchandise, and rustic farm stays, often designed to offer a sensory connection to a supposedly ancestral past. Might these performances of authenticity possibly strip the olive of its deeper connection with labor, ritual, and place-based knowledge? Sacred practices once embedded in community and land stewardship risk being diminished into mere spectacle. In many cases, the narrative of the olive is catered to tourist expectations and experience, raising the question: who has the right to claim, reinvent, or market this ancestral network? And what is the role of the olive today in this conversation of authenticity, commodification, and the evolving identity of the Mediterranean?

### Conclusion: The "Eastern Mediterranean"
Though this interdisciplinary approach to the olive has encompassed many perspectives, there still remain unanswered questions. For example, for a plant so central to the economic, ritual, and social life of the Eastern Mediterranean, the olive is surprisingly absent in much of the surviving visual culture of pre-modern societies. Unlike the grapevine or wheat stalk, the olive rarely appears on artifacts such as vases, coins, murals, or sculpture. Perhaps this is due to the gaps in the archaeological discoveries, or perhaps it reflects the olive’s position not as an ornamental symbol, but as a lived, utilitarian presence in daily life. Regardless, its enduring impact on the landscapes and culture of the Mediterranean is undeniable.

Furthermore, we have seen the olive operate as more than food or nourishment. It is a boundary marker, a sacred gift, a prize of honor, a healer, a bearer of memory. From the mythic wisdom of Athena to the communal labor of harvests, from ancient grafting metaphors of spiritual kinship to the contested understanding of identity, the olive mediates relationships. In tracing the olive across sacred, ancestral, and contemporary landscapes, one comes to see that it is not merely a crop but a living network. The olive binds the Eastern Mediterranean through a shared set of practices, relationships, and meanings that are constantly being negotiated.

Finally, we reach the broader question: what is the Eastern Mediterranean? Is it a specific place? How far in all cardinal directions does it reach? Many consider California in North America as the "New Mediterranean" due to similar climate and conditions, so does it belong to this conversation? There is no fixed answer. But in a world where a bottle of olive oil has reached kitchen countertops across the globe, the olive offers us a glimpse of a region shaped not by geographic borders or individual identities. Instead, the olive represents a beacon of hope through continuity and change, rootedness and reinvention.

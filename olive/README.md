### Introduction
<i>Olea europaea</i>, better known as the olive tree, has long shaped and been shaped by the built and cultivated landscapes of the Eastern Mediterranean. Though many may first associate the olive with the "Mediterranean diet," its significance goes beyond just cuisine. Between tree, fruit, and oil, the olive traverses sacred foundations, ancestral practices, and contemporary reinventions. What might this one plant reveal about how people in the Eastern Mediterranean have defined their identities, histories, and landscapes across time? More specifically, how has the olive become a marker of community and a means of place-making?

### Sacred Landscapes
You might recall learning about the myth of how the ancient city of Athens received its name. On top of the city’s acropolis, a legendary competition unfolded: Poseidon struck the ground to summon a spring of seawater, while Athena gifted the people an olive tree. Although one was a grand display of power, the other’s strength lay in its enduring utility. The competition resulted in a clear victor, crowning Athena as the patron goddess of the city. Her gift of the olive became a living testament to her wisdom, seen today in the continued presence of olives in Athens’ landscape and their ubiquity worldwide.

While this mythic contest may be the most celebrated story of the olive tree in antiquity, the olive makes an often forgotten, yet no less significant, appearance in Homer’s Odyssey--an appearance that reveals the overlooked and deeply ideological symbol of the olive. After many trials and a long journey, Odysseus finally returns to his home Ithaca in Book 13. Homer describes the initial view of the island:
>At the harbor’s head a branching olive stands
>
>with a welcome cave nearby it, dank with sea-mist,
>
>sacred to nymphs of the springs we call the Naiads.
